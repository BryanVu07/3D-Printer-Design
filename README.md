# README for MIE243 Group Design Project: FDM Speed 3-D Printing

## Course Overview

This project is part of the MIE243 course on Mechanical Design, focusing on conceptual design for an FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3-D printer. The primary objectives are to develop a printer that prioritizes printing speed, maintains acceptable print quality, and targets a competitive price point within the hobbyist market.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to:
1. **Design a 3-D Printer**: Create a conceptual design for a printer that achieves high printing speeds similar to current market leaders while ensuring quality suitable for hobbyist use.
2. **Conduct Research**: Understand the current state of the art in 3-D printers, including features, capabilities, and design considerations.
3. **Develop Engineering Specifications**: Outline key specifications such as size, cost, and features that will guide our design choices.
4. **Iterative Design Process**: Engage in a rigorous design process, documenting our research, sketches, and decisions, ultimately arriving at a well-defined final design.

## Project Details

### Background

Recent advancements in the 3-D printing market, particularly with models like Bambu Lab’s X1C and QIDI TECH’s X-Max 3, have introduced rapid printing technologies and enhanced features that were once exclusive to high-end machines. Our design will focus on incorporating these advancements while remaining cost-effective.

### Design Requirements

1. **Printing Speed**: Our printer should match or exceed the speed of existing models like the X1C.
2. **Acceptable Print Quality**: Define "acceptable" quality parameters for hobbyists.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Target a price point that competes with entry-level hobbyist printers.
4. **Features**: Implement essential features like automatic leveling, print monitoring, and efficient filament handling.

### Research Focus

We will familiarize ourselves with:
- The mechanics of FDM printing.
- Existing designs to identify best practices and avoid copying.
- User experience factors, including setup and maintenance requirements.

## Team Structure

Our group consists of four members, and we will utilize weekly tutorials with the TA to guide our progress and refine our design approach. Effective communication and professionalism are paramount as we collaborate on this project.

## Deliverables

1. **Introduction and Research**: Overview of the current state of 3-D printers and our design focus.
2. **Engineering Specifications**: A detailed outline of our design goals and requirements.
3. **Candidate Designs**: Preliminary sketches or CAD drawings of at least three potential designs.
4. **Design Analysis and Description**: Selection of the best candidate design, detailing its operation and chosen mechanisms.
5. **CAD Drawings and Models**: A complete set of manufacturing and assembly drawings for our final design.

## Conclusion

This project is a valuable opportunity to enhance our design and CAD skills, preparing us for future coursework and potential employers. We will document our process meticulously and strive for a design that meets the needs of hobbyists while pushing the boundaries of current technology.
